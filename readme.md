A reactive metaprogramming framework
===

The purpose of this repository is to experiment with the creation of a metaprogramming tool based on XML and nodejs.

I will define a specific reactive programming metalanguage though any kind of metalanguage will be easy to build.

Given the existence of [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) in nodejs, the tools to parse xml are already there. I will only need to define good metaprogramming languages.
