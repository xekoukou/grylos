1. index_functions and find node histotical dependencies is conditionally executed and thus needs to be encapsulated.
2.?? asynchronous nodes must be able to be set at lower levels as well.
4. ?? Generate_src algorithm is a mess. Find a better one.

5. Provide mutatio checks that all mutable varriables execute in deterministic order.

6. Change the generate src so as to provide info about the mutable varriables.


7. Remove _v(number) from the end.

9. Side-effects from single_use or reusable functions do not propagate to the functions that called them. Do that.
