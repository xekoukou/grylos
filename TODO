7. Remove _v(number) from the end.

9. Side-effects from single_use or reusable functions do not propagate to the functions that called them. Do that.

10.Update the order_nodes to generate the correct information. The historic property indicates that a specific output is historical, not the whole node.

11. Fix the bugs on the input_external_var on the order_nodes functions. Possibly split the generation of this information to multiple functions. (Push that after the check_deterministic mutation because then we propagate the mutation property to the correct edges.)

12. No loops with historical values.

13. bt functions should not have mutable variables or they should be ignored with a warning.

14. Provide a check that existence of DYN functions also has a side-effect about it at the xml file.

15. Single_use , reusable, dynamic functions should contain input type info forrust and similar languages.
