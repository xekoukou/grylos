7. Remove _v(number) from the end.

9. Side-effects from single_use or reusable functions do not propagate to the functions that called them. Do that.

10.Update the order_nodes to generate the correct information. The historic property indicates that a specific output is historical, not the whole node.

11. Fix the bugs on the input_external_var on the order_nodes functions. Possibly split the generation of this information to multiple functions. (Push that after the check_deterministic mutation because then we propagate the mutation property to the correct edges.)

12. No loops with historical values.

13. bt functions should not have mutable variables or they should be ignored with a warning.

14. Provide a check that existence of DYN functions also has a side-effect about it at the xml file.

15. Relax the mutability check to allow multiple outputs of a mutable varriable as long as one of them is mutable and all others are deterministically ordered before the next mutation.

16. Introduce a "parallel" edge property so that the next node/functions is computed n times (vector)  and the results are also saved in a vector.
At the moment, it might be easier to implement a new syntax:

PARALLEL:ITER:Vector1,Vector2 function(var1,var2, var3, Vector(v(i)))
