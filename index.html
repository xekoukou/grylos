## Introduction 

**Metareact** is a programming framework and a compiler that was build with the purpose of making 
decentralized programming easier. It is part of the software that will be used by [ryaki](http://ryaki.org),
 an organization that aims to build p2p productive processes, like Uber, but with an emphasis on Democracy 
above all other [properties](http://ryaki-org.blogspot.gr/2015/10/it-is-about-democracy-not-economic.html).

The rise of automation and the emergence of p2p production processes has introduced new requirements 
for software both technical and ethical.

The automation of production processes by computers makes it more difficult for people to understand the reasons behind the choices of the computer. People have to do what the program tells them to do. This already happens inside companies where each employer doesn't know why he does something. If automation claims more parts of our lifes, things will get worse.
Metareact tries to alleviate this problem by requesting that all p2p automation software use free software licenses(GPL) and by making these software easier to read. The end goal is that any person whose life is automated by software should be able to understand the software code and be able to change it. Metareact is build with this on mind:

1. It uses [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming). Each program is a book that contain pieces of code. The book explains the motivation behind the code.
2. It uses visual graph representations as the form of programming distributed applications that make them much easier to read and understand. 

Apart from the ethical requirements of automating p2p processes, there are technical problems as well. Writing distributed applications is very difficult. Thus it requires a considerable amount of capital for them to be built. Investors have the tendency of controlling whatever they invest on. Uber for example has created a very good p2p application but the control of that application has resulted in making a fortune while the people that work as taxi drivers earning very little. Thus, if we want to create a myriad of p2p processes that are democratic, we need to decrease the cost of building them.
In what way does metareact help in simplifying the development of distributed applications?

* It is reactive and functional.
  * Side effects either do not exist or are explicitly handled.
  * There either has no shared mutable state or that state must follow rules that make it safe. 
Those rules are checked by the compiler.
  * The visual graph representation consists of a number of functions and their composition. There are no loops.
The graph can be read as a series of statements and the program needs to guarantee their logical consistency.

ex. pseudocode:
```
f(x) = 2x
g(x) = 5 - x

f->g

function j(x) {

var g = 0;

return 5;
}

```

When x = 2, f = 4, thus g must be 1, otherwise the program would be logically inconsistent.
Being similar to declarative programming, it allows for easier reasoning than imperative programming with mutable state.

* It makes statefull distributed programming easy.
  * Metareact uses the graph visualization to define finite state machines. The code follows the logic of the application.
Finite state machine code is generated by the compiler. This is the most important feature of metareact because p2p processes are statefull. 
  * It is easy to split finite state machines and create a hierarchy of them. That is important because p2p processes and group organizations are fractal.

* It introduces a metaprogramming framework, [protein](https://github.com/xekoukou/protein). This allows people to make abstractions of the p2p processes. It allows them to create models of them. 
  * Models compresses information about the p2p processes into the important parts and that allows people to better understand them and reason about. 
  * It allows them to create a multitude of different p2p processes using the template system of the model and thus it reduces the cost of programming.

Other Metareact properties:

* **Order of execution**: Because metareact is reactive and functional, the order of execution doesn't follow the sequence of the arguments. As we stated before the only thing that metareact wants to guarantee is the logical consistency of the arguments. Thus the order of execution is irrelevant. But there are cases where we order is relevant. For such cases, we need to explicitly write that the order must be preserved.
* **Lossful Computation**: There are cases in which we only care about the current value of the output of a computation and we can omit intermediary values.(ex. receiving data from sensors) In other case, we need all outputs from all data. Metareact allows for both types of computations.
* Metareact code is **implicitly concurrent** and **explicitly parallel**. With a single character, a piece of graph becomes parallelized. There is no possibility for dead locks.
* Metareact uses a **multi-level visual graph representation** that allows people to organize code thematically.
